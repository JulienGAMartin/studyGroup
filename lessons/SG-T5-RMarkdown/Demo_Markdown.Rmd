## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r plot_cars, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
plot(cars)
```

```{r plant_summary}
summary(PlantGrowth)
```

```{r plant_box, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
boxplot(weight ~ group, PlantGrowth, col=c("pink","lightgreen","purple"))
legend("topleft", legend=c("Group","Control","Treatment1","Treatment2"), pch=c(NA,19,19,19), col=c(NA,"pink","lightgreen","purple"))
```
